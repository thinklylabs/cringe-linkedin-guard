**Privacy Policy**  
Effective Date: 16th Feb 2025  

**Data Collection**  
Cringe Guard does not collect, store, or share any personal data. The extension processes LinkedIn posts in real-time within your browser to determine whether they match filtering criteria. No user data, login credentials, or browsing history is collected.  

**API Usage**  
When you use Cringe Guard:  
- The content of LinkedIn posts is sent to Gemini's API for analysis to determine relevance.  
- Your API key is stored locally in your browser and is never transmitted elsewhere.  
- The extension does not store or retain any analyzed data after processing.  

**Third-Party Services**  
Cringe Guard relies on Gemini's API to analyze LinkedIn posts and classify content based on filtering rules. We do not control how Gemini handles data, so we encourage you to review [Gemini's privacy policy]\ for details on their data processing practices.  

**Permissions Justification**  
- **activeTab**: Needed to analyze and modify the LinkedIn feed in real-time.  
- **storage**: Used to save user preferences, such as filtering settings and API configurations.  
- **host permissions (linkedin.com)**: Required to read and process LinkedIn content for filtering purposes.  

**Security Measures**  
- The extension does not execute remote code or store external scripts.  
- API interactions are limited to filtering LinkedIn content; no other browsing data is sent or processed.  
- All user preferences remain stored locally within the browser.
